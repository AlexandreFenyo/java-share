# JavaShare

Target platform: J2ME

JavaShare is a client/server software for email and file transfer under unreliable and low-bandwidth environments (for instance with a PDA using a network connection on top of PPP through an IrDA channel established with a mobile GSM phone). The communications are compressed and an interrupted transfer is restarted at the last position.
